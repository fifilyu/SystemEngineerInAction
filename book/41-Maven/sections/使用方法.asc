mvn clean:: 清除
mvn compile:: 编译，compile the source code of the project
mvn validate:: 验证mvn配置，validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
mvn test:: 运行单元测试，test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
mvn verify:: 验证编译后的程序，run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
mvn install:: 安装应用到maven目录，install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
mvn deploy:: 编译，done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
mvn package:: 打包，take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
